  "slogan_space_pen_content_1": "The technology that went into creating the Space Pen in the 1960s cost more than one million dollars and took countless hours of research, experimentation and testing in order to achieve this superior writing instrument. No detail was overlooked including its solid aluminum outer casing, inner brass fittings, precision steel socket and ultra-hard tungsten carbide ball. Engineered for comfort and precision, the pen is perfectly balanced in hand with a gratifying weighted feel. Today, that same technology is now available in a design customized by Das&nbsp;Keyboard.",

  "our-story_content": "In 2005, in a personal quest to improve his own typing speed and accuracy, Metadot founder and self-proclaimed \u201cUber Geek\u201d Daniel Guermeur (Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/supercobra\">@supercobra</a>) asked to have a totally blank keyboard created. To his surprise, his typing speed doubled after just a few weeks of use. As many friends and colleagues who tested the keyboard were mesmerized and wanted one, the business potential became obvious, and Das&nbsp;Keyboard was born. The keyboard was spruced up with precision and individually weighted keys,  and Birgit Schroeder undertook the mission of bringing it to market a few months later. It was an instant success, especially among techno-elitists searching for the latest and greatest way to differentiate themselves from mere \u201ctechie\u201d mortals. It also became popular within the education sector as schools and universities looked for more effective ways to teach typing.  </p>\n\n<p>In 2006 an enhanced version of Das&nbsp;Keyboard was released. Still completely blank, the Das&nbsp;Keyboard II featured high-end gold-plated mechanical key switches. Reminiscent of the well-known and loved IBM Model M Keyboard, the Das&nbsp;Keyboard II was more responsive than the first model and generated a distinct \u201cclick\u201d with each keystroke, quickly establishing it as \u201cthe keyboard that clicks.\u201d Like its predecessor, the Das&nbsp;Keyboard II was a hit among gadget gurus, gizmo elitists and touch-typers who required speed and reliability.  </p>\n\n<p>In 2008 the makers of Das&nbsp;Keyboard decided to upgrade the keyboard again. Their goal was to make the best keyboard on the planet. The result: the Das&nbsp;Keyboard Professional with traditional key markings and the Das&nbsp;Keyboard Ultimate with blank keys. With the introduction of its first keyboard with key inscriptions, the Professional, Das&nbsp;Keyboard expanded its market beyond the Uber Geek segment to include anyone who spends significant time on a computer and wants an enhanced typing experience. Featuring mechanical key switches, n-key rollover functionality, a USB hub, and a longer (6.6-foot) cable, the Das&nbsp;Keyboard Professional and Ultimate offer a new and unique tactile experience that takes keyboarding to a whole new level.  </p>\n\n<p>Das&nbsp;Keyboard is now available with or without inscriptions to all who want the nirvana of typing experiences.</p>\n\n<p>In July 2013, Das&nbsp;Keyboard released the world's first Radio Frequency Blocking Bags. This product line was designed to protect against location tracking, theft and digital intrusion. Known as Das&nbsp;Keyboard HackShield bags, the company\u2019s one-of-a-kind backpack and messenger bags empower professionals on-the-go with a new level of protection.</p>\n\n<p>The following October, Das&nbsp;Keyboard designed a bag especially for gamers called the Gaming Sling. Designed for gamers on the go, the Das&nbsp;Keyboard Gaming Sling protects gamers\u2019 gear like no other bag does. It is super durable, designed for high utility and clean style. It has dedicated compartments for a keyboard, mouse and headset plus additional pockets for accessories, flash drives, cables and other props needed to destroy competition.</p>\n\n<p>In March of 2014, the Das&nbsp;Keyboard 4 Professional and Ultimate are launched bringing exciting new features to the mechanical keyboard. The Das&nbsp;Keyboard 4 features an aluminum top panel for extra durability, dedicated media controls with oversized volume nob, and a two-port USB 3.0 SuperSpeed hub to download and transfer files in a flash. In a Wired article, the Das&nbsp;Keyboard 4 was described as \"a German luxury car, smoothly cruising in the fast lane at high speed.\" The Das&nbsp;Keyboard 4 Professional has laser etched inscriptions and The Das&nbsp;Keyboard 4 Ultimate is completely blank.</p>\n\n<p>In January 2015, Das&nbsp;Keyboard launched the Das&nbsp;Keyboard 4C Compact Mechanical Keyboard. The Das&nbsp;Keyboard 4C features a sleek compact tenkeyless design. The new addition to the Das&nbsp;Keyboard family is quipped with a dedicated Windows disable key for better gaming, NKRO for faster typing, aluminum top panel for lasting durability, and two-port USB 2.0 High-Speed hub for quick and easy file transfers. The space saving design helps to claim some desk space back without compromising quality. </p>\n\n<p>In March, Das&nbsp;Keyboard announced yet another addition to the mechanical keyboard line, introducing the Das&nbsp;Keyboard 4 Professional for Mac into the market. The new mechanical keyboard for Mac users has the same great features as the Das&nbsp;Keyboard 4, but offers some additions that only Mac power-users would need. In addition to standard Command and Alt/Option keys, Das&nbsp;Keyboard 4 Professional for Mac offers quick, convenient access to a number of other Mac specific key functions.",

  "Mechanical Keyboard Terminology text": "<strong>Actuation Point</strong> is the point at which the contact mechanism registers a key press. <strong>Key Blocking</strong> is when multiple keys are depressed simultaneously, your keyboard will not recognize future keystrokes until the original keys are lifted. Keyboards have a maximum number of keys it can register at one time and if you depress more than its limit, it won\u2019t register the other key presses. <strong>Key Ghosting</strong> can occur when three keys are pressed at once and a fourth keystroke you did not press is registered by your computer. <strong>Key Rollover</strong> is the number of keys that can be pressed in succession without having to lift a finger from any of the previous keys. Keyboards use the term KRO to represent the maximum number of keys you can press without experiencing any key blocking. NKRO refers to <strong>N-Key Rollover</strong>, the ultimate in keyboards. A keyboard with N-Key Rollover can register as many keys as you can press at once without any key blocking issues. <strong>Reset Point</strong> is the point when the mechanism ceases to register the key press. <strong>Tactile Point</strong> is the point during the keypress at which the bump occurs to indicate to your finger that the key has been actuated.",

Unlike the black switches, the browns have a soft, tactile bump about halfway through the key press. The Brown switches have tactile feedback, but the audio feedback isn\u2019t quite as noticeable as Blue switch. The Brown switches have a softer click when depressed and require less force to actuate. The Cherry MX Brown switches have an actuation force of 55cN.",
  "Clicky Switch: Cherry MX Blue text": "The Blue switches are popular within the typing community because of the \u201cclicky\u201d tactile bump when the activation point is hit. The overall experience of Blue switches is very similar to typewriters allowing typist to hear the audible feedback when the key is registered and feel a nice tactile bump. This helps to increase typing speed and reduces bottoming out. The Cherry MX Blue switches have actuation force of 60cN.",
  "Linear Switch: Cherry MX Black text": "Cherry MX Black switches are linear, or non-tactile, this means that Black switches don\u2019t have a loud click or a bump that is felt when a key is depressed.

The Cherry MX Black switches have actuation force of 60cN.",
  "Linear Switch: Cherry MX Red text": "Cherry MX Red switches are similar to the Cherry MX Blacks in that they are both categorized as linear, non-tactile. This means that their feel remains constant through each up-down key stroke. Where they differ from the Black switches is in their resistance; Red switches require less force to actuate. The result is a feel that most perceive as \u201csmoother\u201d and \u201cfaster,\u201d making them especially popular among gaming enthusiasts. The Cherry MX Red switches have actuation force of 45cN.",
  "Light Tactile Switch: Cherry MX Clear text": "Cherry MX Clear switches are a bit harder to find in keyboards, but many users consider them to have more of a tactile feel than the Browns without being as clicky as the Blue switches. The clear switches have a higher actuation force than the Brown switches and a more pronounced tactile bump. Also, Clears tend to have the most friction among mechanical key switches, this is due to the size of the tactile bump. The Cherry MX Clear switches have actuation force of 65cN.",

The switches are preferred in games when double-tapping is critical for survival and having a soft tactile bump is preferred to know when each key is registered. The Alpha-Zulu Tactile switches have actuation force of 45g.",
  "Alpha-Zulu Linear Switch text": "The Alpha-Zulu Gaming Switch with Linear Experience is a non-tactile switch and remains constant with each key press. The switches have a smooth and fast feel making them popular amongst gamers who prefer to have a quiet keyboard while gaming. The Alpha-Zulu Linear switches have actuation force of 45g.",
  "Membrane vs. Mechanical Keyboards text": "The most inexpensive keyboards, like the ones that come with computers, utilize a flexible membrane layer beneath the keys. When you press a key, it causes the membrane to press down and make contact with a bottom layer. An issue with this type of keyboard is that the key must be completely pressed, also known as \u201cbottoming out\u201d, in order to register. There is also little to no tactile feedback. Without tactile feedback it is very difficult to type without bottoming out every keystroke. Mechanical keyboards, however, use a switch underneath every key. Depending on the type of switch, they have a variety of response and travel times. The differences amongst them include the tactile feel and audible click each produces. Switches on a mechanical keyboard are made to last to 50-60 million keystrokes. Compared to membrane switches, which typically last around 1-10 million keystrokes. A mechanical keyboard is the only keyboard with the capability to register all keys at one time, also known as full N-Key Rollover. This is helpful for fast typists that need to hit keys in quick succession and gamers who need to mash key combos quickly. Plus, not having to bottom out with each key allows you to type faster with less energy, significantly improving typing and gaming speed.",

His typing speed doubled after just a few weeks of use. Many friends and colleagues who tested the keyboard were mesmerized and wanted one and Das&nbsp;Keyboard was born. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/values/images/first-blank.jpeg\" alt=\"firstkeyboard\" title=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>The keyboard was spruced up with precision and individually weighted keys. Birgit Schroeder undertook the mission of bringing it to market a few months later to a larger . It was an instant success, especially among techno-elitists searching for the latest and greatest way to differentiate themselves from mere \u201ctechie\u201d mortals. It also became popular famous within the education sector as schools and universities looked for more effective ways to teach typing.</p>\n\n<p>In 2006 an enhanced version of Das&nbsp;Keyboard was released. Still completely blank, the Das&nbsp;Keyboard II featured high-end gold-plated mechanical key switches. Reminiscent of the well-known and loved IBM Model M Keyboard, the Das&nbsp;Keyboard II was more responsive than the first model and generated a distinct \u201cclick\u201d with each keystroke, quickly establishing it as \u201cthe keyboard that clicks.\u201d Like its predecessor, the Das&nbsp;Keyboard II was a hit among gadget gurus, gizmo elitists and touch-typers who required speed and reliability.</p>\n\n<p>Since Start, Das&nbsp;Keyboard has continued bringing smart innovation and all-new features to provide ultimate experience and create high quality mechanical keyboard designed to meet the demanding needs of elite typists, Uber-Geeks, professional IT and professional gamers.",
